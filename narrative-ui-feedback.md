## Feedback on the narrative UI interface

* Unfade/highlight cells on hover, not just click
* Use a simple wysiwyg in the markdown cells
* Only use the left side panel for listing data. Remove app search from this area as it's too cramped
* Add a prominent element at the bottom of the narrative/window for adding an app which opens the app search modal
* Use a large-screen modal for searching for apps with lots of screen real estate
  * Be able to search apps by input and output types
